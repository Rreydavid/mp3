question 1) This code smell is duplicated code. The refactoring that can be
		applied to remove this repeared statements is to put it
		in it's own function call 
question 3) This code smell is feature envy. The method updateAndTrim should be moved to the jenkins class.
question 4) Since this is duplicated code, can change this into a for loop and
                check for the condition and then append as needed. Or instead
                you can turn that into a function and call it each iteration
                of the loop and check the condition in the function call
question 6) The code smell we decided to resolve was located at jenkins/core/src/test/java/hudson/scheduler/CronTabTest.java.
		This code smell is duplicated code, as the same 20 lines are used at both line 99 and 121.
		To refactor this code move the repeated code to a new method, and replace the blocks of code with a method call.
